# Project 1: Dice Roll Generator
A project using Python's random library to calculate probability as well as compare the differences between random and psuedorandom. The program asks a user for number of times to roll two dice (using larger numbers may take a long amount of time to process and be CPU intensive). It then generates two random numbers between 1 and 6 using the random library and adds them together to simulate a dice roll. After this the program displays statistics on how many times each number was rolled, the expected probability of each result, and the difference between actual and expected. There is another program included named random_num. Instead of generating two numbers, this program generates one number between 2 and 12. This gives insight on how psuedorandomly generated numbers create a uniform distrubution as user-input numbers grow larger, while the die roll shows a parabolic relationship where the number 7 is the most likely to be rolled number. Also included in this file is a .pdf going into more detail on the results of this program.


# Project 2: Password Check
A project using nested methods and user input to make a password checker which only allows a password of decent strength. The program accepts two Strings and checks if they are the same (Enter Password, Confirm Password). These Strings must meet several parameters outlined by the methods. They must be at least 8 characters, they cannot start with the & or * symbols, they must contain a letter, number and symbol, they must contain no spaces, and they cannot repeat the same character 3 times in a row. The program lists the parameters that the users password does not meet, as well as accepts it once all parameters are met.


# Project 3: State Quiz
A project using imported data from an unsorted text document to create a quiz on states and capitals. The program imports the list of names from a text document, then sorts them into the correct categories as either states or capitals. Once these are sorted, the program asks the user if they would like to be quizzed on states or their capitals. After the user decides, either a state or a capital will pop up. The user will then input a response and the program will tell them if they are correct or incorrect. The program then asks them if they would like to play again, and continues on the same topic. At any time the user may leave the program or keep asking for more questions.


# Project 4: Coding Theory
A project showing how Coding Theory works by detecting and correcting possible errors in codewords inputted by a user using Hamming codes. User must understand binary and perfect codes in order to understand how the program is working and what it is doing. 


# Misc:
Assorted unfinished projects such as converting audio into binary data, some audio tool practice, and gui practice.
